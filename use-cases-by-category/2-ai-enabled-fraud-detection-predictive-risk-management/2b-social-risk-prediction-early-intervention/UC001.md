## Overview

Pakistan Ehsaas programme biometric verification system implemented by NADRA using fingerprint scans and facial recognition technology for fraud prevention and payment authentication in social assistance delivery. The system was originally designed with fingerprint-based biometric verification but NADRA specifically implemented facial recognition capabilities for the Ehsaas program in 2020 to address pandemic-era verification challenges and technical difficulties. The facial recognition addition was particularly important for serving elderly and disabled beneficiaries who often have faint or unclear fingerprints that create barriers to accessing social assistance payments.

The system integrates computer vision and biometric authentication technologies to provide identity verification at payment points and prevent fraudulent benefit claims. While the system has improved identity assurance for legitimate beneficiaries, documented challenges include false rejection rates affecting vulnerable populations and connectivity issues in remote areas that limit system effectiveness. The implementation represents an augmentation approach where AI enhances rather than replaces existing verification processes within Pakistan's national social protection infrastructure.
