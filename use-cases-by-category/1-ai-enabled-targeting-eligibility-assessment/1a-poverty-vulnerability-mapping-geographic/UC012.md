## Overview

Nigeria AI-powered poverty mapping system using deep learning algorithms, satellite imagery analysis, and telecoms data fusion for social protection targeting and beneficiary identification. The system evolved from World Bank research collaboration (2021) demonstrating proof-of-concept using satellite imagery and household survey correlation, to full operational government deployment (2025) by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Reduction with multi-modal data integration including telecoms base station data and financial service access indicators.

The operational system successfully expanded Nigeria's National Social Register from 13 million to 19.7 million people through sophisticated urban slum identification and multi-modal AI data fusion approaches. The system now combines satellite imagery analysis with telecoms data extraction, AI-powered phone number validation, and financial services access assessment to generate comprehensive lists of urban poor populations for social assistance program enrollment. World Bank institutional validation confirms the system accuracy as 'sufficiently accurate to function as standalone targeting method' with 636,000 beneficiaries processed through the Rapid Response Registry. The deployment demonstrates successful transition from academic research to operational government implementation with documented measurable outcomes in social protection delivery expansion.
