## Overview

DRC STEP-KIN program COVID-19 emergency cash transfer using satellite imagery for hotspot mapping and mobile phone CDR (Call Detail Records) exclusion criteria for vulnerability targeting in Kinshasa. The program served 456,000 beneficiaries from March 2021 to June 2022 as part of emergency pandemic response targeting urban poor populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital.

The system utilized satellite analytics and mobile phone data analysis to identify COVID-19 hotspots and apply exclusion criteria based on CDR data patterns to target vulnerable populations while avoiding areas with higher transmission risks. Implementation was documented in the World Bank's comprehensive report "Scaling Up Social Assistance Where Data is Scarce" as a successful example of rapid AI deployment for emergency social protection response.

The program demonstrated the feasibility of using novel data sources including satellite imagery and telecoms data for emergency targeting when traditional survey-based approaches were impractical due to COVID-19 restrictions. The STEP-KIN implementation represents completed status with documented beneficiary outcomes and represents one of the largest-scale emergency AI targeting implementations in Sub-Saharan Africa during the pandemic period.
