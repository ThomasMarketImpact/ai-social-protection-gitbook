## Overview

Pakistan National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER) automated eligibility assessment system using real-time Proxy Means Test (PMT) calculation and machine learning classification algorithms for social protection targeting. The system, operational since 2018, initially focused on social assistance programs but has expanded scope to include targeted utility subsidies for electricity and gas distribution. The ML classification system processes household survey data, socio-economic indicators, and administrative registry data to automatically assess beneficiary eligibility and program prioritization.

A significant documented outcome is the dramatic improvement in emergency response capabilities, with system response time reduced from 2 months during early COVID-19 period to just 10 days during 2023 flood emergency response. The system employs multi-layered verification processes and grievance mechanisms as safeguards, though risks include data accuracy dependencies and potential inclusion/exclusion errors. Implementation follows an augmentation approach where AI enhances human decision-making in eligibility determination, operating within Pakistan's National Social Protection Framework and supporting gender-sensitive targeting with disability considerations integrated into registry data collection processes.
