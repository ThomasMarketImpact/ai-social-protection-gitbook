## Overview

Malawi Canva Cash Transfers tele-targeting method using Call Detail Records (CDR)-based consumption scores for rural Lilongwe targeting, validated against Integrated Household Survey 5 (IHS5) survey data. The program served 3,052 beneficiaries representing 24% of total program participants (12,800 total) through the CDR-based targeting methodology with documented inclusion/exclusion error rates of 17% compared to 13% for traditional Proxy Means Testing (PMT) approaches.

The system utilizes machine learning classification algorithms to analyze mobile phone usage patterns and generate consumption-based poverty scores for rural populations where traditional survey data collection is challenging or expensive. Technical implementation processes CDR data through algorithms that correlate mobile usage patterns with household consumption levels, validated through comparison with IHS5 survey results for accuracy assessment.

World Bank documentation indicates the approach achieved acceptable targeting accuracy despite slightly higher error rates than PMT methods, with significant advantages in deployment speed and cost-effectiveness for rural targeting scenarios. The implementation demonstrates completed pilot status with documented comparative performance analysis and represents innovative application of telecoms data for social protection targeting in Southern Africa context, with methodology documented for potential adaptation in similar rural contexts across the region.
