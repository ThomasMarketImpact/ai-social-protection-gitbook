## Overview

Togo Novissi Model 2 COVID-19 rural expansion using machine learning algorithms combining satellite imagery, Call Detail Records (CDR) data, and household survey information for canton-level poverty mapping and individual-level welfare assessment. The program served 139,000 beneficiaries across 200 poorest cantons as part of Togo's COVID-19 social protection response strategy.

The system represents an evolution of the original Novissi urban targeting model, extending AI-powered targeting capabilities to rural populations through multi-modal data fusion approaches. Technical implementation combines satellite imagery analysis with CDR-based mobility and consumption patterns, validated against household survey data to generate canton-level poverty maps and individual welfare scores.

World Bank analysis documented targeting accuracy of 54% recall rate compared to 63% for traditional Proxy Means Testing (PMT) approaches, indicating mixed performance outcomes with trade-offs between speed of deployment and targeting precision. The system achieved operational status with ongoing beneficiary service delivery and represents one of the most comprehensive multi-modal AI targeting implementations in West Africa, with methodology documented in World Bank institutional reports for potential replication across similar contexts.
