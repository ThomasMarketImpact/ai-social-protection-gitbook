## Overview

Togo Social Safety Net Project post-pandemic multi-stage targeting approach combining satellite imagery analysis, crowd-sourced data collection, SWIFT-PMT (Survey-free Wealth Index from Feature Tables-Proxy Means Testing), and community validation processes for comprehensive beneficiary selection in permanent social protection programming.

The system represents Togo's transition from emergency COVID-19 response targeting to sustainable social safety net implementation, building on lessons learned from the Novissi program experiences. The multi-stage approach integrates satellite analytics for geographic targeting, crowd-sourced data for local context validation, automated SWIFT-PMT calculations, and community-level validation processes to create comprehensive targeting frameworks.

Implementation status remains in pilot phase with evaluation framework development ongoing. The system is documented in World Bank institutional analysis as part of comprehensive review of novel data applications in social assistance scaling. NOTE: Additional technical documentation required for complete analysis including specific algorithms used, community validation protocols, SWIFT-PMT integration methods, and operational outcomes from pilot implementation for comprehensive literature review coverage.
