## Overview

UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) proposed Contact Centre AI system to enhance citizen engagement and support through conversational AI and natural language processing technologies. The Tony Blair Institute proposal envisions AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants that can handle routine inquiries, provide benefit information, guide citizens through application processes, and escalate complex cases to human advisors. The system would integrate with existing DWP contact centre operations to provide 24/7 service availability while reducing wait times and improving service accessibility for benefit claimants and citizens seeking social protection information. Implementation emphasizes seamless handoffs between AI and human advisors, maintaining service quality while improving operational efficiency and citizen satisfaction with DWP services.
