## Overview

Ecuador social registry outreach optimization system using machine learning algorithms that combine social registry data with satellite imagery analysis to identify uncovered households and guide social worker outreach activities for improving social protection program coverage. The system was developed through collaboration with Prosperia.ai technology partners and successfully identified 41 priority outreach areas in experimental implementation phase, demonstrating proof-of-concept for satellite-based targeting approaches in Latin American contexts.

The methodology was specifically designed for potential application across similar Latin American contexts with comparable social registry systems and geographic characteristics, with initial pilot testing conducted in Ecuador's diverse geographic regions. The system uses computer vision and satellite analytics to process existing social registry information and identify geographic areas where vulnerable households may be missing from social protection databases, enabling more targeted and efficient outreach efforts by field staff.

NOTE: Original documentation referenced potential Costa Rica co-development partnership, but country-specific implementation details and operational outcomes are currently limited to Ecuador pilot results. Additional comprehensive documentation needed for complete literature review analysis including detailed technical specifications of satellite imagery processing methods and machine learning algorithms used, social worker feedback systems and field integration protocols, household identification accuracy rates and validation approaches against ground-truth data, operational integration mechanisms with Ecuador's existing social protection infrastructure, cost-effectiveness analysis compared to traditional outreach methods, scalability assessment for national implementation, and lessons learned for broader Latin American regional application in similar social registry contexts.
