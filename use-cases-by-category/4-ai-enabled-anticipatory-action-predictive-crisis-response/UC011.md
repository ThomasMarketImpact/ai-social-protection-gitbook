## Overview

Pakistan high-resolution flood susceptibility mapping system using multi-sensor satellite data fusion (Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 optical, and Landsat-9) with machine learning-based population and infrastructure exposure assessment for emergency response targeting and disaster preparedness policy design. The system processes satellite imagery through computer vision algorithms and geospatial analytics to identify flood-vulnerable areas at 30-meter spatial resolution, representing a significant improvement over traditional 250-meter to 25-kilometer resolution approaches used in previous vulnerability mapping efforts.

The system identifies approximately 95 million people (47% of Pakistan's population) exposed to high flood risk, with detailed analysis showing 74% of Sindh province population and 56% of Punjab province population in high-risk areas. Technical implementation uses XGBoost and LightGBM gradient boosting algorithms with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, processing data through Google Earth Engine cloud infrastructure. The system demonstrates strong validation against official poverty statistics with documented correlation coefficients above 0.814, and has been applied for COVID-19 Rapid Response Register geographic targeting with proven accuracy in identifying 'pockets of poverty' within wealthy areas such as Lagos urban settlements.
