## Overview

Armenia social protection needs prediction system using artificial intelligence-driven vulnerability assessment and predictive analytics for identifying at-risk populations and anticipating social protection service needs before crises develop. The system was referenced in Digital Convergence Initiative materials as part of Armenia's development of predictive social protection capabilities, indicating government interest in proactive rather than reactive social assistance approaches.

The predictive system represents Armenia's commitment to developing anticipatory social protection mechanisms that can identify vulnerable households before they experience acute need, potentially improving program effectiveness while reducing long-term costs through early intervention approaches. The vulnerability assessment component suggests integration of multiple data sources for comprehensive risk profiling.

NOTE: Substantial additional documentation required for comprehensive literature review inclusion and thorough technical analysis. Current available information limited to workshop references indicating development status without operational details or performance metrics. Essential research documentation needed includes technical implementation details of predictive algorithms and data science approaches, comprehensive data sources used for vulnerability assessment including administrative data integration, prediction accuracy metrics and validation approaches, institutional implementation strategies and stakeholder engagement processes, operational integration mechanisms with existing social protection delivery systems, privacy protection and data governance frameworks, pilot testing results and lessons learned, and broader applicability assessment for similar post-Soviet transition economy contexts.
