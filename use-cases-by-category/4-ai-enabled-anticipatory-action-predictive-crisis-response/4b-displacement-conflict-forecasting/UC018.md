## Overview

Chile Alerta Infancia child welfare risk assessment system using advanced data intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms to cross-reference multi-institutional administrative data and generate risk scores for children vulnerable to rights violations. The system processes health status records, educational attendance data, family socio-economic context information, and environmental risk factors from multiple government agencies to create comprehensive vulnerability assessments for minors at risk of rights violations or abuse.

The system was developed as part of Chile's National Agreement for Childhood (Acuerdo Nacional por la Infancia) announced in May 2018, with planned deployment to municipal offices nationwide within five years. Current operational status includes 12 communes actively using the system to serve 2,262 children with capacity for 3,440 annual interventions, with expansion planned to 345 communes nationwide. However, the system faces significant criticism from human rights experts and child welfare advocates who identify substantial risks including data privacy violations affecting minors, cybersecurity vulnerabilities with sensitive data, algorithmic stigmatization of vulnerable children, and lack of transparency in risk determination criteria. The Universidad Diego Portales Human Rights Annual Report 2024 provides comprehensive academic analysis documenting algorithmic discrimination concerns, privacy violations, and inadequate data protection frameworks in the system's implementation.
